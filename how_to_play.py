#Hello there, I have added this file to help myself understand the game logic better.

#To play the text-based adventure game, follow these steps:

#Step 1: Run the Game in VS Code
#Open VS Code.

#Navigate to your project folder (where TBAG.py is saved).
#Open the terminal in VS Code by pressing Ctrl + ~.
#Use the command to move to your project directory (if needed)

#Step 2: How to Play the Game
#Once the game starts, you will see descriptions of the current room and prompts to enter commands.

#Gameplay Instructions:
#Moving Between Rooms:

#The game will ask:
#Which direction do you want to go?

#Type a direction based on available options, such as:

#north (go north)
#south (go south)
#east (go east)
#west (go west)

#Press Enter to move to the next room.

#Example Game Flow:

#Output example:

#css

#You are in the Kitchen
#A room with delicious smells and shining appliances.
#Which direction do you want to go?

#You type:
#south

#The game responds:
#You are in the Dining Hall
#A grand hall with a long wooden table.

#Talking to Characters (if applicable):

#Some rooms may have characters. If a character is present, you will see a message like:
#Dave is here!
#If prompted, type talk to interact with the character.

#Handling Errors:

#If you enter an invalid direction, the game will say:
#You can't go that way.
#Simply try another direction.

#Step 3: End the Game
#To exit the game at any time, press Ctrl + C in the terminal.

#Step 4: Example Walkthrough
#Suppose the rooms are linked like this:

#[ Kitchen ] --- south ---> [ Dining Hall ] --- west ---> [ Ballroom ]

#Start in the Kitchen.
#Type south to go to the Dining Hall.
#Type west to go to the Ballroom.
#Explore and interact with the game world.

#Step 5: Adding More Features
#If you'd like to extend the game, you can modify the script to:

#Add more rooms and directions.
#Introduce inventory and items (e.g., pick up objects).
#Add more character interactions.
